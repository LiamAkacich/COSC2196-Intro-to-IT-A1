<section>
    <h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>     Information technology has always been a dynamic part of my life. There are so many facets of the topic that I enjoy and take interest in, so it is always changing and evolving.
    <br>    My fascination with IT started when I was introduced to console gaming at the age of 8. It started with a PlayStation 1 and evolved into a general understanding of how computers and other IT systems worked. When I was 15 I was introduced to game coding, and I spent many hours learning how to use a software called Gamemaker Studio. This interest moved into PC building, and PC gaming which added to my knowledge base of IT that I now use every day.
    <br>    Currently my main interests in IT stem from my job in the managed service provider space. 
    <br>    I work in a fast-paced helpdesk environment that has to deal with lots of different business IT solutions. At work I am interested in software solutions such as Microsoft 365, Sophos managed antivirus and firewall deployments. I enjoy configuring business and user specific software so that my customer's work life is easier when it comes to IT. I find solving problems satisfying, and it is even better when the work I do has a positive effect on someone else's life. I also get to practice effective communication which I enjoy too.
    <br>    In my personal life my main IT interests involve automotive electronics and home networking. I have a passion for cars, and I enjoy integrating cool electronics and gadgets into my car, that both make my car safer and more pleasurable to drive. I have also recently moved out of home into my own house, so I have had to use my IT skills to create a home network for my PC’s and other devices. I have found this very rewarding because I get to use the skills I have acquired from my job to make my network environment function exactly how I want it to.
    </p>
    <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
    <p>     I chose to start studying with IT for several reasons. Firstly, I had become frustrated with my career progression due to not having completed any formal certifications or degrees. I realised that it would aid in furthering my career if I had a degree. Furthermore, I started to understand what I wanted to do with my life, and where I wanted to be in the next five to ten years. To achieve these goals, I knew I needed to have a higher income to support them, after doing some job searching I felt that having a degree would be a great help in my objective to start building a successful life. 
    <br>    With my current work life balance, I was concerned that I wouldn’t have time for study, so I started to research universities that offered flexible online learning. I found that studying IT with RMIT, through Open Universities Australia would fit into my life. 
    <br>    I'm hoping that my studies with help me extend my industry knowledge from working in IT for almost two years.  I expect that I will find new interests within IT, and that I will be able to build my passion for IT into a successful career. 
    <br>    My plan is to pair at bachelor's degree of information technology with industry experience and industry recognised certifications, such as Microsoft certificates etc. I feel as though having this knowledge will give me a good profile when searching for employment in the industry.

    <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>     The advertised position for IT support officer with the Tasmanian Department of Education is a role that includes remote and onsite support for the staff in the education department. It involves supporting equipment such as enterprise server infrastructure, PC endpoints and cloud software platforms.
    <br>    This job is appealing to me since I have had experience as an onsite technician with a multi-site aged care provider called Masonic Care Tasmania. In that position I reported to an IT manager and my daily tasks included user IT support and taking care change requests. I got to experience working with servers and how they are strategically set up in a network so that they achieve desired IT outcomes for users and administrators. I found this very rewarding in my early days in the IT industry because it exposed me to situations that taught me the industry standard for IT infrastructure management.
    <br>    From speaking with the contact person for the position, this role is very similar to the role I fulfilled at Masonic Care Tasmania. It includes visiting schools and department offices to solve IT issues involving both hardware and software. IT also involves understanding how the core systems that are used by the department function, so that troubleshooting can be supported by core system knowledge.
    <br>    The skills required were listed in the selection criteria for the position. They expect applicants to have skills in desktop PC support including peripherals and networking, equipment deployment and maintenance, as well as software development and installations. Another important quality applicants need to possess is the ability to communicate effectively and have good interpersonal skills. Conceptual and analytical problem solving knowledge is also needed. Sine the role puts you into a team of technicians and IT support officers, having the ability to work well in a team is important too.
    <br>    My current skill set contains most of the listed requirements, and I am confident that my application would be considered. Since my experience at Masonic Care Tasmania was very similar, I am confident this is a role I could perform well in. It would also provide me with more learning opportunities, since I’m certain that the department of education uses IT solutions I have limited knowledge on.
    <br>    An area of the position that was mentioned was software development. This is a topic that I have a low amount of experience in. My plan to grow my knowledge in this area is to complete the introduction to programming unit of my degree. I feel as though this will give me a good foundation into some of the areas that are required in this position.
