<h1 style="text-align:center;">Assessment 1: My Profile</h1>

<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
<section>
<p>     Information technology has always been a dynamic part of my life. There are so many facets of the topic that I enjoy and take interest in, so it is always changing and evolving.
<br>    My fascination with IT started when I was introduced to console gaming at the age of 8. It started with a PlayStation 1 and evolved into a general understanding of how computers and other IT systems worked. When I was 15 I was introduced to game coding, and I spent many hours learning how to use a software called Gamemaker Studio. This interest moved into PC building, and PC gaming which added to my knowledge base of IT that I now use every day.
<br>    Currently my main interests in IT stem from my job in the managed service provider space. 
<br>    I work in a fast-paced helpdesk environment that has to deal with lots of different business IT solutions. At work I am interested in software solutions such as Microsoft 365, Sophos managed antivirus and firewall deployments. I enjoy configuring business and user specific software so that my customer's work life is easier when it comes to IT. I find solving problems satisfying, and it is even better when the work I do has a positive effect on someone else's life. I also get to practice effective communication which I enjoy too.
<br>    In my personal life my main IT interests involve automotive electronics and home networking. I have a passion for cars, and I enjoy integrating cool electronics and gadgets into my car, that both make my car safer and more pleasurable to drive. I have also recently moved out of home into my own house, so I have had to use my IT skills to create a home network for my PC’s and other devices. I have found this very rewarding because I get to use the skills I have acquired from my job to make my network environment function exactly how I want it to.
</p>
<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
<p>     I chose to start studying with IT for several reasons. Firstly, I had become frustrated with my career progression due to not having completed any formal certifications or degrees. I realised that it would aid in furthering my career if I had a degree. Furthermore, I started to understand what I wanted to do with my life, and where I wanted to be in the next five to ten years. To achieve these goals, I knew I needed to have a higher income to support them, after doing some job searching I felt that having a degree would be a great help in my objective to start building a successful life. 
<br>    With my current work life balance, I was concerned that I wouldn’t have time for study, so I started to research universities that offered flexible online learning. I found that studying IT with RMIT, through Open Universities Australia would fit into my life. 
<br>    I'm hoping that my studies with help me extend my industry knowledge from working in IT for almost two years.  I expect that I will find new interests within IT, and that I will be able to build my passion for IT into a successful career. 
<br>    My plan is to pair at bachelor degree of information technology with industry experience and industry recognised certifications, such as Microsoft certificates etc. I feel as though having this knowledge will give me a good profile when searching for employment in the industry.
